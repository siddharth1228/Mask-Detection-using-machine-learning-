# Mask-Detection-using-machine-learning

CoronaVirus Disease(COVID-19) has affected all of us in various ways. It has affected the health sector, business sector, education and many more fields. People have been confined inside their houses in isolation due to which their daily life has been affected. CoronaVirus Disease is transmitted by air through droplets. It is recommended by the World Health Organization(WHO) to wear masks for preventing the rapid spread of CoronaVirus. In order to run the daily lives, people need to go out for purchasing basic needs and for their work. And a little bit of negligence in this scenario like no masks could spread the virus in an unprecedented manner. This negligence has been considered to formulate our project idea. Video surveillance for detecting masks in public places has been utmost necessary. In this project, weâ€™ll build a machine learning model using Mobile Netv2 and CNN algorithms. The model will be able to detect if a person is wearing a mask or not. The project uses both image processing and video processing. The project hence can be implemented in public places for detecting unmasked faces and requesting them to wear masks. This will more or less help in prevention of CoronaVirus.
